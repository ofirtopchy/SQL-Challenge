### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

````sql
select s.customer_id , spend=sum(me.price)
from   sales as s join menu as me on me.product_id= s.product_id
group by s.customer_id 
````

#### Steps:
- **join** ```sales``` and ```menu``` to get sales price.
- **Group by** and **SUM** to find out ```spend``` by each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |

- Customer A spent $76.

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

````sql
select s.customer_id , visits = count (DISTINCT s.order_date)
from   sales as s
group by s.customer_id 
````

#### Steps:
- Using **DISTINCT** and **Count** to find out ```visit_count```
- I used distinct to avoided double counting: when a customer bought several products on the same day

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

```sql
select  distinct(s1.customer_id), s1.order_date , m.product_name
from sales as s1 join menu as m on m.product_id= s1.product_id
where s1.order_date = (select 
                      [first buy] = min(s2.order_date)
                      from   sales as s2
					  where s1.customer_id = s2.customer_id
                      group by s2.customer_id
					  )
````

#### Steps:
- Use **Passing Parameters** method for each customr take only the product which them order date ```s1.order_date``` is ```min(s2.order_date)```


#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
