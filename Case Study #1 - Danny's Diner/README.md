    ### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
    
    ```sql
    select s.customer_id , spend=sum(me.price)
    from   sales as s join menu as me on me.product_id= s.product_id
    group by s.customer_id 
    ```
    
    #### Steps:
    - **join** `sales` and `menu` to get sales price.
    - **Group by** and **SUM** to find out `spend` by each customer.
    
    #### Answer:
    
    | customer_id | total_sales |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | A           | 76          |
    | B           | 74          |
    | C           | 36          |
    
    - Customer A spent $76.
    - Customer B spent $74.
    - Customer C spent $36.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
    
    ```sql
    select s.customer_id , visits = count (DISTINCT s.order_date)
    from   sales as s
    group by s.customer_id 
    ```
    
    #### Steps:
    
    - Using **DISTINCT** and **Count** to find out `visit_count`
    - I used distinct to avoided double counting: when a customer bought several products on the same day
    
    #### Answer:
    
    | customer_id | visit_count |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | A           | 4           |
    | B           | 6           |
    | C           | 2           |
    
    - Customer A visited 4 times.
    - Customer B visited 6 times.
    - Customer C visited 2 times.

    ```sql
    select  distinct(s1.customer_id), s1.order_date , m.product_name
    from sales as s1 join menu as m on m.product_id= s1.product_id
    where s1.order_date = (select 
                          [first buy] = min(s2.order_date)
                          from   sales as s2
                          where s1.customer_id = s2.customer_id
                          group by s2.customer_id
                          )
    ```
    
    #### Steps:
    
    - Use **Passing Parameters** method for each customr take only the product which them order date `s1.order_date` is `min(s2.order_date)`
    
    #### Answer:
    
    | customer_id | product_name |
    | ----------- | ------------ |
    | A           | curry        |
    | A           | sushi        |

           from sales as s join menu as m on s.product_id=m.product_id
             group by m.product_name
            ) as x 
    order by x.num desc
    ```
    
    #### Steps:
    
    - Using **Nested Querie** output **table** to crete temporary table repsants each product and number of time has been purchased (`x`)
    - Using **TOP** and **ORDER BY desc** to retrieve the first line. viz the item has beeen has been purchased mostly.
    - Using **Group by** and **COUNT( )** to find out how many time each item has been purchased.
    
    #### Answer:
    
    | most_purchased | product_name |
    | -------------- | ------------ |
    | 8              | ramen        |

    group by s.customer_id ,m.product_name
    )
    as x

    - Using **Nested Querie** output **table** to crete temporary table,For each customer, how many products did he/she purchase of each type (`x`)
    
    - Using **WINDOWS FUNCTION** `dense_rank()` to find out the number of purchases
    
    - #### Answer:
      
      | customer_id | product_name |

    )
    as x
    where rank=1
    ```
    
    #### Steps:
    
    - Using FROM **Nested Querie** output **table** to crete temporary table,For each customer rate the product has been purchased by (`x`)
